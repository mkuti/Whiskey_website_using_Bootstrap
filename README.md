# Whiskey website as mini-project of the Full Stack Code Institute course!

Hello

As a mini-project at the end of Full Stack first module, I followed course video content and tried to copy the coding to learn how to use HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap classes. It gave me a very good insight of the two languages and how to use effectively the Bootstrap libray while customising to our own styling.
